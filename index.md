## About

IndicSwipe is aimed at developing a keyboard that supports gesture typing on mobile devices for Indic languages. IndicSwipe provides a novel Deep Learning architecture that jointly uses Transformers and LSTMs to accurately decode noisy swipe inputs and has been tested on 7 Indic languages. To further research in this field, we release two datasets that are generated by simulations that model human motor control using the principles of jerk minimization. The models and datasets have been developed to cater to two closely related tasks:

1. **Indic-to-indic Decoding:** To support users who prefer to type in the native Indic script (Devanagari, Bengali, etc.)
2. **English-to-indic Decoding:** To support users who prefer to type using an English script keyboard but want the output in the native script.

IndicSwipe demonstrates high decoding accuracies varying from 70% to 95% on both tasks across 7 languages.

### Quick start: Use as a GitHub Pages remote theme

1. Add Just the Docs to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml` as a [remote theme](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/)
```yaml
remote_theme: pmarsceill/just-the-docs
```
<small>You must have GitHub Pages enabled on your repo, one or more Markdown files, and a `_config.yml` file. [See an example repository](https://github.com/pmarsceill/jtd-remote)</small>

### Local installation: Use the gem-based theme

1. Install the Ruby Gem
```bash
$ gem install just-the-docs
```
```yaml
# .. or add it to your your Jekyll site’s Gemfile
gem "just-the-docs"
```
2. Add Just the Docs to your Jekyll site’s `_config.yml`
```yaml
theme: "just-the-docs"
```
3. _Optional:_ Initialize search data (creates `search-data.json`)
```bash
$ bundle exec just-the-docs rake search:init
```
3. Run you local Jekyll server
```bash
$ jekyll serve
```
```bash
# .. or if you're using a Gemfile (bundler)
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
4. Point your web browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

If you're hosting your site on GitHub Pages, [set up GitHub Pages and Jekyll locally](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) so that you can more easily work in your development environment.

### Configure Just the Docs
